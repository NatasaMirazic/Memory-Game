# Memory-Game

## Description

A memory game is created as an internal project for my portfolio. With this game, you can test your memory.

This game starts with all the cards facing down. When you click some card, it flipped face up and you should find their pair. Only two cards can be opened at the same time. The goal of this game is to find all pairs in the shortest possible time.

When you open a game, you can choose which level (difficulty) you want to play. There are three options: easy, medium and hard.

Easy: 6 pairs ie 12 cards

Medium: 9 pairs ie 18 cards

Hard: 12 pairs ie 24 cards

While you are playing, the time is running. When you finish a game, if your result (time) is on top 10, you can enter your name and the result is being saved as a high score for that level (difficulty). You can access the high score table for the main menu.

At the end of the game, you can start a new game, view high scores or go to the main menu.

Good luck!
